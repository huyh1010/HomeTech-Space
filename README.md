# Hometech Space - Smart Home Electronic E-Commerce MERN stack

## Application Description

• This application offers a wide range of affordable smart home devices products at the moment where electronic equipments are unaffordable out of reach for the majority of consumers.

• It is designed to help people buy electronic goods at a low-cost price. The application predominantly specializes in smart home devices only which allow customers to find these products easily without having to search the key term "smart home devices" or "smart electronic home appliances" when they are browsing on a similar application. The application also offers a bundle options; customer can select these bundle which consists of multiple electronic products rather than select each product at a time.

• This application provides a list of home device products labeled and grouped based on their category. User will automatically see a displayed UI feature of the product categorization which helps enhance their shopping experience. In each category, the application also provide a filtering section based on the product specification (ex: price, brand name, size, dimension or weight...).

• This application also provides a webpage feature which display a list of grouping products (from different category) in a bundle (product combo or package) at a reasonable price to allow the user to select and purchase without having to browse through other product webpage based on their category.

• This application also contains a simple chat box between users to interact. 

• An integration with third-party login providers (Google & Facebook) is included in the application.

• This application contains a data visualization for seller(admin) to track the product status.

• While the HomeTech Space does provide a viable choice for user to browse through products, we hope to implement a "popular section" feature to allow customer to look at the platform's best-selling product. We also hope to build a customization webpage feature that allows user to select their product from scratch. While our bundle options does provide somewhat similar feature, the products in the bundle are pre-selected by the store and user are not allowed to adjust and select their own preferred product in the bundle. It would be amazing to also include a customer's review section for product reviews.
